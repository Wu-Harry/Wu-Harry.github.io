I'm a first-year MPhil student from [deparment of biostatistics](https://sph.pku.edu.cn/info/1044/3528.htm), Peking University, advised by [Prof.Baosheng Liang](https://sph.pku.edu.cn/info/1700/5057.htm). Before that, I received my Bachelor degree (2023) in bioinformatics (major in statistics) from Peking University. My research interests include Survival analysis, Semioparametric model, Machine learning and Causal inference. If you are interested in my research or have any questions, please contact me without hesitation.
